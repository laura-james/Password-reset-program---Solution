# Instructions  

Password reset program 
Only accept a new password if it is:
1. At least eight characters long
2. Has lower case and upper case letters.

The password reset program should also make the user input their new password twice so that the computer knows that the user has not made any mistakes when typing their new password.
## Extensions: 
1. Make some sort of algorithm to suggest how strong the password is (Weak, Medium, Strong) depending on length, whether or not the password has special characters in etc
2. Let the user input their username. The program should go to a text file with a list of usernames and old passwords, and the program should only let you change your password if 
you input your old password
